solana-test-validator

# Or test will use existing localnet
```

### Execute Tests
```bash
# Run system flow test
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8899 \
ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json \
npx ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/system-flow-test.ts

# Or use anchor test (with --skip-local-validator if validator already running)
anchor test --skip-local-validator tests/system-flow-test.ts
```
