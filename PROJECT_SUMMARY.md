- ✅ Tiered fee structure based on volume
- ✅ Referral rewards system

- ✅ Configurable fee parameters

**Key Files:**
- `programs/fee_management/src/lib.rs` - Main program
- `programs/fee_management/src/instructions/` - Fee operations

## 📊 Program Statistics

| Program | Instructions | Accounts | Lines of Code |
|---------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Exchange Core | 10 | 5 | ~1,500 |
| Escrow | 6 | 2 | ~800 |
| Governance | 8 | 5 | ~1,200 |
| Fee Management | 8 | 5 | ~1,000 |
| **Total** | **32** | **17** | **~4,500** |

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### PDA-Based Security
All programs use Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for secure authority management:
- No private keys needed for program-controlled accounts
- Deterministic address generation
- Cross-program invocation (CPI) support

### Token Safety
- SPL Token program integration for all token operations
- Isolated vaults for each trading pair
- Atomic transaction guarantees

### State Management
- Efficient account packing to minimize rent
- Linked list structure for order books
- Comprehensive error handling

### Governance
- Decentralized control via token-based voting
- Multiple proposal types for different operations
- Treasury management for protocol funds

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Access Control**
   - `has_one` constraints for ownership verification
   - Signer requirements on sensitive operations
   - Authority validation on admin functions

2. **Arithmetic Safety**
   - All calculations use checked math
   - Overflow protection throughout
   - Proper error handling

3. **State Validation**
   - Input validation on all parameters
   - State transition guards
   - Account discriminator checks

4. **Token Security**
   - PDA-controlled vaults
   - Atomic transfers
   - No token authority exposure
