## 🚀 How to Run (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Test Validator
```bash
# In terminal 1 (keep running)
solana-test-validator --reset
```

### Step 2: Run Tests
```bash
# In terminal 2 (from project root)
cd /home/rahul/projects/solana_stock_exchange
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify on Explorer
Open the Solana Explorer links shown in the test output to verify all on-chain states.

## ✨ What Gets Tested

### Real Blockchain Operations ✅

All of these are **actual blockchain transactions** on Solana localnet:

✅ Exchange PDA initialization
✅ Trading account creation
✅ Order book deployment (2 markets)
✅ SPL token minting (TECH, FIN, USDC)
✅ Token distribution to users
✅ Fee configuration setup
✅ Escrow account initialization
✅ Token vault creation
✅ Balance tracking
✅ State changes
✅ PDA derivation
✅ Transaction signatures

### Mocked Off-Chain Services 🎭

These simulate off-chain components:

🎭 KYC verification process
🎭 Company listing applications
🎭 Compliance team reviews
🎭 Regulatory approvals
🎭 Market announcements

## 📊 Expected Results

When you run the tests, you'll see:

```
🚀 SOLANA STOCK EXCHANGE - INTEGRATION TESTS

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  🔧 SETUP: Initializing Test Environment
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ✓ Exchange Authority: [ADDRESS with Explorer link]
  ✓ Mock users created with SOL
  ✓ Mock companies created with tokens

[... tests execute ...]

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  🎉 TEST SUITE COMPLETE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ✅ All 26 test cases passed
  ✅ 50+ blockchain transactions executed
  ✅ 15+ PDA accounts created
  ✅ All states verifiable on Solana Explorer
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Methods

### 1. Solana Explorer (GUI)
Direct links provided in test output:
```
https://explorer.solana.com/address/[ADDRESS]?cluster=custom&customUrl=http://localhost:8899
```

### 2. Solana CLI (Command Line)
```bash
# View account
solana account [ADDRESS]

# Check token balance
spl-token balance [MINT] --owner [OWNER]

# Confirm transaction
solana confirm -v [SIGNATURE]
```

### 3. Automated Assertions
Test suite automatically verifies:
- Account creation
- Balance changes
- State updates
- PDA data

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Test fails?
```bash
# 1. Check validator is running
solana cluster-version

# 2. Rebuild everything
anchor clean && anchor build && anchor deploy

# 3. Run again
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh
```

### Program ID mismatch?
```bash
# Update program IDs after redeployment
anchor deploy
# Check Anchor.toml matches deployed programs
```

### SPL Token errors?
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```
