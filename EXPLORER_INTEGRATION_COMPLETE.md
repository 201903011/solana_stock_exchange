## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Bookmark Important URLs
After first test run, bookmark:
- Admin account
- Token mint pages
- Explorer homepage with custom RPC

### Tip 2: Use Terminal Hyperlinks
Modern terminals (VS Code, iTerm2, Windows Terminal) make the URLs **clickable**:
- Just click the link in terminal output
- Browser opens automatically
- No copy-paste needed!

### Tip 3: Compare Before/After
```bash
# Before trade
1. Open Alice's Explorer page
2. Note balance: 100 SOL

# Run trade test
3. Execute test

# After trade
4. Refresh Explorer page
5. See new balance: 89.95 SOL
6. View transaction history showing the trade
```

### Tip 4: Export Account Data
From Explorer, you can:
- Copy raw account data (JSON)
- View account layout
- Inspect PDA seeds
- Analyze rent status

### Tip 5: Track Block Production
Explorer homepage shows:
- Current slot
- Block height
- TPS (transactions per second)
- Recent blocks updating in real-time
